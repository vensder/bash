You need to surround PATTERN in double quotes:

PATTERN="/opt/apps/bin/lighttpd.bin -f /opt/apps/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf\$"
pgrep -f "$PATTERN"

See: quoting variables
Edit: and for echoing i would just do:

echo pgrep -f \'$PATTERN\'


As I don't have lighttpd.bin available to test with, I am submitting an untested option, mostly agreeing with @barti_ddu, but with a slightly different twist

PATTERN='/opt/apps/bin/lighttpd.bin -f /opt/apps/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf\$'
pgrep  -f "$PATTERN"
echo pgrep  -f "$PATTERN"

I would keep the single quotes on the assingment to PATTERN, but totally agree you need the dbl-quoting when using with pgrep or echo.
